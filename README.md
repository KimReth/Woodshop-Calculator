## About The Project
This Woodworking Calculator is a windows form application that I created for my brother-in-law to assist him in the woodshop. He came up with all the math to determine if specific pieces of wood could be used to create butcher blocks and I made it into a program for him.
Within the Calclations method I added a comment section that contains his breakdown of what each variable represents.
